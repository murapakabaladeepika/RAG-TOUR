    "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
    "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
    "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
    "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
    "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
    "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
    "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
    "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
    "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",
    "The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.\n",
    "•Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.\n",
    "•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.\n",
    "•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.\n",
    "•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.\n",
    "•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.\n",
    "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
    "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",

    "The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights\n",
    "Matterport Runs on Cortex\n",
    "Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.\n",
    "Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
    "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
    "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
    "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
    "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
    "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
    "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
    "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",
    "Extensible Platform Ecosystem\n",
    "Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets. We are also developing a third-party software marketplace to extend the power of our spatial data platform with easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access Matterport software add-ons. The marketplace enables developers to build new applications and spatial data mining tools, enhance the Matterport 3D experience, and create new productivity and property management tools that supplement our core offerings. These value-added capabilities created by third-party developers enable a scalable new revenue stream, with Matterport sharing the subscription and services revenue from each add-on that is deployed to subscribers through the online marketplace. The network effects of our platform ecosystem contributes to the growth of our business, and we believe that it will continue to bolster future growth by enhancing subscriber stickiness and user engagement.\n",
    "Examples of Matterport add-ons and extensions include:\n",
    "•Add-ons: Encircle (easy-to-use field documentation tools for faster claims processing); WP Matterport Shortcode (free Wordpress plugin that allows Matterport to be embedded quickly and easily with a Matterport shortcode), WP3D Models (WordPress + Matterport integration plugin); Rela (all-in-one marketing solution for listings); CAPTUR3D (all-in-one Content Management System that extends value to Matterport digital twins); Private Model Emded (feature that allows enterprises to privately share digital twins with a large group of employees on the corporate network without requiring additional user licenses); Views (new workgroup collaboration framework to enable groups and large organizations to create separate, permissions-based workflows to manage different tasks with different teams); and Guided Tours and Tags (tool to elevate the visitor experience by creating directed virtual tours of any commercial or residential space tailored to the interests of their visitors). We unveiled our private beta integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT TwinMaker to enable enterprise customers to seamlessly connect IoT data into visually immersive and dimensionally accurate Matterport digital twin.\n",
    "•Services: Matterport ADA Compliant Digital Twin (solution to provide American Disability Act compliant digital twins) and Enterprise Cloud Software Platform (reimagined cloud software platform for the enterprise that creates, publishes, and manages digital twins of buildings and spaces of any size of shape, indoors or outdoors).\n",
    "Our Competitive Strengths\n",
    "We believe that we have a number of competitive strengths that will enable our market leadership to grow. Our competitive strengths include:\n",
    "•Breadth and depth of the Matterport platform.

    "This includes support for LiDAR cameras, 360 cameras, smartphones, Matterport Axis and the Matterport Pro2 and Pro3 cameras. The Pro2 camera was foundational to our spatial data advantage, and we have expanded that advantage with an array of Matterport-enabled third-party capture devices. In August 2022, we launched and began shipment of our Pro3 Camera along with major updates to our industry-leading digital twin cloud platform. The Matterport Pro3 Camera is an advanced 3D capture device, which includes faster boot time, swappable batteries, and a lighter design. The Pro3 camera can perform both indoors and outdoors and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Along with our Pro2 Camera, we expect that future sales of our Pro3 Camera will continue to drive increased adoption of our solutions. Matterport is democratizing the 3D capture experience, making high-fidelity and high-accuracy 3D digital twins readily available for any building type and any subscriber need in the property life cycle. While there are other 3D capture solution providers, very few can produce true, dimensionally accurate 3D results, and fewer still can automatically create a final product in photorealistic 3D, and at global scale. This expansive capture technology offering would not be possible without our rich spatial data library available to train the AI-powered Cortex engine to automatically generate accurate digital twins from photos captured with a smartphone or 360 camera.\n",
